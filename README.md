Ontology for Preclinical Trials in Radiation Oncology (PTRO)

<h3>About</h3>

The ontology for Preclinical Trials in Radiation Oncology (PTRO) represents: 
i) Demographic characteristics of mice.  
ii) Findings or information collected during a study, like body weight, cause of death, clinical observation. 
iii) Exposure information such as treatment name, route of administration, treatment vehicle. 

The ontology follows the design principles from [the Radiation Oncology Ontology (ROO)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30144092/)
