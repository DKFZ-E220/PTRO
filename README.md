# PTRO
Ontology for Preclinical Trials in Radiation Oncology (PTRO)

<h3>About</h3>

The ontology for Preclinical Trials in Radiation Oncology (PTRO) represents: 
i) Demographic characteristics of mice.  
ii) Findings or information collected during a study, like body weight, cause of death, clinical observation. 
iii) Exposure information such as treatment name, route of administration, treatment vehicle. 

To ensure interoperability with other biomedical and healthcare ontologies, the PTRO ontology reuses part of [the Radiation Oncology Ontology (ROO)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30144092/) and incorporates [the Semantic Types Ontology (STY)](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/STY) as a framework for broad concept categorization.
